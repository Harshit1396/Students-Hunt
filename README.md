Problem Statement <-
A leading Real Estate Company has recently constructed a building for corporate offices and co-working spaces. They want to make this building the best infrastructure there is in terms of preferred work destination and safety. For this reason, they have hired you as a data scientist to help them solve the countless number of problems they face everyday.
One such problem is a resource allotment problem. On the basis of how many people are actually present in the building at any given moment, the decision is made on how many personnel should be allotted in the building, whether it be for catering or for security purposes, etc. 
Your task is to predict the footfall for the next few months. You have been given the number of people which are currently in the building on an hourly basis.
